> I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki!

## Introduction

**A work in progress for Global Hackathon**

*Khaleesi* is the web client of the *AskDrogo* application. AskDrogo is an application that provides accurate and real time translations for items such as text, speech and video. Imagine the possibilities of talking, real time, to the Dothraki without actually understanding their language!

## Why Khaleesi?

*The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.*
Yep. Can't do much here.

## Structure

Built with AngularJS and Material Design. Communicates with the AskDrogoAPI.
